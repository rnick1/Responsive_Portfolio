# Responsive_Portfolio

# This repository is for my second homework assignment for the University of Washington Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp!

### The goal of this assignment is to utilize HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap skills to create a personal portfolio that is responsive at different screen sizes.

## The Assignment:

* Functional, deployed application
* GitHub repository with README describing the project
* Navbar must be consistent on each page.
* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
* All links must work.
* Must use semantic html.
* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### To accomplish this, I took the examples provided and created an application with my personal information. Here are the specifics:

## What was done:

-My navbar on all three pages is setup outside the bootstrap container so it can stretch the full width of the page. I liked having the nav buttons in the top left, so I kept them there as a matter of personal styling. I also liked the darker color provided by bootstrap as it frames the page nicely along with a similarly colored footer.

-It took me awhile to get used to the grid system because at first I did not realize that having a container automatically adds space to both sides of the page. The central card on each of the three pages was darker than the surrounding columns and rows to draw the reader's eye to the content.

-I have no copyright information, so I just added the footer with my name in faded lettering.

-The main bootstrap features I used were: navbars, containers, cards, and footers.

## Possible improvements:

-If I had more time, I would style the page further with card borders, additional colors, a background picture of something nice, more exciting looking buttons, and a more detailed portfolio page.

## Overall, this was a very fun assignment! I feel comfortable using bootstrap and making webpages responsive to different screen sizes. I also feel even more confident with my HTML, CSS, and GitBash terminal skills!
